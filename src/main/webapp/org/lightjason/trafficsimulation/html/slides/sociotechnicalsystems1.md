## Lecture 1

_INTELLIGENT AGENTS AND Multiagent SYSTEMS: AN INTRODUCTION_

*   Motivation and basic definitions
*   Socio-technical systems
*   Example: vehicle agent
*   Agent-based modelling and simulation
*   Agent architectures
    *   Reactive
    *   Ant-based
    *   Practical reasoning
    *   Belief, Desire, Intention


---
## What is this about?

We aim at understanding, modelling, building complex, ”intelligent” autonomous systems
So what? – humans have been doing this for a long time …
*   James Watt – Steam Engine
*   Weather forecast
*   Traffic flows and traffic forecast
*   Energy network management
*   Finance markets …

But
*   Often unclear system boundaries
*   What if systems are not hierarchically, centrally organized?
*   Often simplifying assumptions regarding behaviour of system parts
*   Forecasting the weather doesn’t change it, forecasting traffic …?
*   Often, it doesn’t work properly


---
## Socio-technical systems (STS) <sup><sup>(Singh, 2014)</sup></sup>

Combine (information) technology with real-life societal considerations
System characteristics
*   Longevity and openness
*   Societal requirements, often characterized by norms
*   Indirect ”control” mechanisms (sanctions, incentives, markets, …)


---
## Socio-technical systems (STS) <sup><sup>(Singh, 2014)</sup></sup>

Member characteristics
*   Longevity and identity
*   Human or automated (humans not as users, but as part of a system)
*   Autonomy (goals, capabilities) and heterogeneity

Realization
*   Top-down: Members fit into existing systems
	*   Adopt suitable goals given system norms
*   Bottom up: Members design new systems
	*   Negotiate suitable norms given individual goals


---
## The ”3M” approach to modelling socio-technical systems
![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_004.png#centering)


---
## Traffic/Smart City Systems are STS!

*   Longlived infrastructure
*   Self-interested, autonomous traffic participants
*   Highly heterogeneous
*   Societal issues: Efficiency, safety, comfort, environmental friendliness, fairness, sustainability
*   Decentral decisions vs. centralized (?) regulation
*   New technologies (automated driving, social networks, digitalization)
    *   influence behaviour of traffic participants
    *   enable new services, business models


---
## Research challenges: understand how


<table>
	<tr>
		<td style="height: 21px">&nbsp;… new technologies and services change

## Example: Pedestrian Modelling

Traditional pedestrian models:
*   pedestrians = homogeneous entities (molecules)
*   physical (fluid) dynamics models to describe flows

Social behaviour: repelling forces between molecules
E.g. Social forces model <sup><sup>(Helbing and Molnar,1995)


---


## Example: Pedestrian Modelling

* Highly simplified model – can model large problems!
* More complex individual goals and motivations?
* Heterogeneous individual capabilities?

## Example: Nagel-Schreckenberg Car Following Model <sup><sup>(Nagel and Schreckenberg, 1992)</sup></sup>

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_016.gif#floatright)

* Microscopic, discrete model
	* based on cellular automata
	* car behaviour determined by state of preceding car
* Use four rules in each step
	1. Increase $$\overrightarrow{v}$$ by 1 if possible
	2. Reduce $$\overrightarrow{v}$$ by 1 if not enough free cells in front 
	3. Reduce $$\overrightarrow{v}$$ by 1 with probability $$p$$
	4. Drive with new $$\overrightarrow{v}$$ (all vehicles)
* Simple, homogeneous, not very realistic (but useful)


---
## Modelling socio-technical systems requires a paradigm change

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_018.png#floatright)

*   Heterogeneous actors, different capabilities, preferences, goals
*   Groups … <sup><sup>(Vizzari et al., 2015)
*   Interaction of human and automated actors
*   Flexible, changing regulatory regimes (rules, norms)

## (Multi-)agent-based modelling and simulation


![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_021.png#floatright)

> is a (computational) modelling and simulation paradigm that uses the concept of a  multiagent system as the basic metaphor of the simulation model <sup><sup>[Klügl, 2013]</sup></sup>

* Microscopic paradigm
* Abstraction: <u>Agent</u> - fine-granular description of (autonomous) system entities <sup><sup>(Jennings et al., 1998)
* Granularity: From cellular to cognitive

---

## (Multi-)agent-based modelling and simulation
*   Abstraction: <u>Multiagent system</u>

>… a (computer) system that is designed and implemented as several interacting agents
>… types of interactions including: 
>cooperation …; coordination …; and negotiation <sup><sup>[Jennings et al, 1998]</sup></sup>

<img alt="" height="280" src="slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_022.png" width="516">


---
## Example: Vehicle agent
![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_026.png)![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_027.png)![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_028.png)

*   Perceives the environment via sensors
*   Maintains a model of the state of the environment
*   Has strategic and tactical goals (speed, lane, route choice)
*   Plans and decides how to reach its goals
*   Executes actions that affect the environment
*   Communicates with driver/passenger, cars, infrastructure
*   Reacts to changes in the environment


---
## Key challenges in agent’s research <sup><sup>(Wooldridge, 2009) </sup></sup>

*   Construct intelligent agents that can carry out actions autonomously on behalf of their users/owners

    * $$\rightarrow$$ Represent knowledge & semantics of knowledge and action

    * $$\rightarrow$$ Behave flexibly and adaptively

    * $$\rightarrow$$ Embedded in environment (sensing & acting)

*   Construct multiagent systems, i.e., systems consisting of agents that can interact with other agents to perform the tasks we delegate to them, and to resolve emerging goal conflicts

    * $$\rightarrow$$ User/agent modelling, personalization

    * $$\rightarrow$$ Communication, coordination, cooperation, and negotiation

    * $$\rightarrow$$ Representing and dealing with semantic interoperability

## Micro- and macro perspective of Agents/MAS

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_029.png#centering)
    
 
---
## History of intelligent agents
*   1930ies: Cybernetics - mathematical model for analogue control
*   1950ies: Physical symbol systems hypothesis <sup><sup>(Simon and Newell)</sup></sup>
    The ability to symbolically represent aspects of the world is a prerequisite for intelligent behaviour (use explicit logical reasoning in order to decide what to do) 
    -> <u>deliberative agents</u>
*   Since mid 1980s: Problems with symbolic reasoning lead to <u>reactive agents/</u>emergent behaviour (since 1985)
*   Since 1990ies
    *   hybrid/layered architectures reconciling deliberation and reactivity
    *   Focus on social-aware agents, cooperation & negotiation


---
## Agents and dynamic systems
Dynamic systems (control theory) consists of
   *   System (Controller)
   *   Environment

Let
   *   T points in time
   *   S possible environmental states
   *   P possible inputs (perception) to system
   *   A possible output (actions) of system

Let
   *   $$s(t)$$ state of environment at time $$t \in T$$
   *   $$p(t)$$ input to system at time $$t \in T$$
   *   $$a(t)$$ output of system at time $$t \in T$$


---
## Components of a dynamic system

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_030.png#centering)


---
## Describing the environment

*   The behaviour of the environment in dynamic systems is described by two functions
*   Actions performed by the system modify the state of the environment: $$s(t+1) = f(s(t), a(t))$$
*   Outputs of the environment (signals) are considered as inputs and result directly from the current state of the environment $$s(t): _p(t) = g(s(t))$$

 
---
## System behaviour: The control problem

*   Task of the system; solving the control problem = Find a sequence of actions to achieve or maintain a desired state of the environment
*   The control problem is often described by two sub-problems:
*   The _state estimation problem_ determines the current state of the environment from the current input into the system
*   The _regulation problem_ determines an appropriate system response (action) given a recognized state of the environment
*   Functions:
    *   State recognition:  est: 
	$$P \rightarrow S$$
    *   Regulator: 		    reg: 
	$$S \rightarrow A$$


---
## Discussion: Agents and dynamic systems

One perspective of agents is that they solve control problems and they can be regarded dynamic systems

But:
* Functions for state estimation and regulation are often incomplete, incorrect, or complex to describe in practical applications
* Functions need to process symbolic knowledge and generate complex, non-numeric output description
* We are looking at distributed systems of loosely coupled agents; control theory does not provide instruments to solve this problem


---
## Discussion: Agents and dynamic systems

Pure control theory models are rarely applicable
*   Failure-prone sensors and actuators (input to est, output of reg)
*   Incomplete, erroneous state model (output of est)
*   System/agent may be in a different state from the one it believes to be in
*   Failure-prone model of effects of actions to environment

But: useful as a basic mathematical model


---
## Minimal abstract agent model (cycle)

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_031.png#floatright)

1.  Start in initial state s
2.  Observe state of environment and create a perception
3.  Update internal state based on perception
4.  Select next action based on internal state
5.  Execute selected action
6.  Goto step 2


---
## Deliberative agents

*   Based on principles of symbolic Artificial Intelligence
*   Knowledge based systems with internal and symbolic representation of environment (”mental state”)
*   Decision-making as symbolic reasoning over mental state
*   Idea: Decision-making as theorem proving
*   Not detailed here …


---
## Reactive agents

* Influenced by behaviourist psychology and biology
  *   Simple internal world representation
  *   Tight coupling of perception and action
  *   Simple decision rules
*   Simon<sup><sup>(1981)</sup></sup>: The complexity of agent behaviour can be a reflection of the complexity of the agent’s environment rather than of the agent’s complex internal design
*   Often: communication via the environment (stigmergy)
*   Model: ant colonies, bee-hives (swarm intelligence)
*   Control architectures: e.g. subsumption architecture by Rodney Brooks


---
## Subsumption architecture <sup><sup>(Brooks)</sup></sup>: Generate intelligent behaviour without explicit representation

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_032.png#centering)
    
    
---
## Control: suppression and inhibition

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_035.png#floatright)

*   S: signal from module (layer k) suppresses (and replaces) input into module (layer k-1) for some pre-determined time
*   I: signal from layer k inhibits output from module (at layer k-1) for some pre-determined time
*   This control is hard-wired

---
## Example: Ant-based routing <sup><sup>(Dorigo et al., 2000)

*   Ants = simple agents that can traverse a graph
*   Ants look for food
*   Ants leave pheromone on the edges they traverse
*   Decision algorithm: Choose the edge with the highest pheromone concentration ![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_038.png)
*   Ant-based algorithms have been successfully used to solve routing and scheduling problems
    
    
---
## Practical reasoning

*   Fundamental limitations to the design of deliberative agents
    *   Transforming subsymbolic data in symbolic form is difficult
    *   Decision algorithms undecidable for first-order language
    *   Worst case co-NP-complete for propositional logic
*   Alternative approach: Practical reasoning
    *   ”Practical reasoning is a matter of weighing conflicting ”considerations for and against competing options, where the relevant considerations are provided by what the agent desires/values/cares aboutand what the agent believes”<sup><sup>(Bratman, 1990)
*   Combines
    * *Deliberation*: What goals to achieve?
    * *Means-Ends Reasoning*: How to achieve goals?
*   Result of deliberation: *Intentions*


---
## Agents as Belief, Desire, Intention (BDI) systems

*   Belief:
    *   information about the current world state
    *   subjective
*   Desire:
    *   preferences over future world states
    *   can be inconsistent (in contrast to goals)
*   Intentions:
    *   set of goals the agent is committed to achieve
    *   the agent’s ”runtime stack”
*   Formal models:
    *   mostly modal logics with possible-worlds semantics
    *   more pragmatic implementations
Underlying theory: Daniel Dennett’s model of intentionality <sup><sup>(Dennett, 1987)



---
## Intentionality: What is an agent?

*   Why would you want to ascribe human-like properties such as beliefs, goals, or intentions to a technical system? <sup><sup>(McCarthy)</sup></sup>

You always can!
*   ’It is perfectly coherent to treat a light switch as a (very cooperative) agent with the capability of transmitting current at will, who invariably transmits current when it believes that we want it transmitted and not otherwise; flicking the switch is simply our way of communicating our desires’. <sup><sup>(Yoav Shoham, 1993)

Yet - Why do we find this absurd?


---
## It’s all about being useful

*   ... because it is not useful for us: we understand the underlying mechanism sufficiently to have a simpler explanation of system behaviour
*   The more we know about a system, the less intentional concepts can help us in describing it
*   The more complex computer systems get, the more we have to rely on abstractions and metaphors to explain their behaviour
*   Considering/modelling a system as an intentional system is such as abstraction and hence a tool to explaining, understanding and (ultimately) programming complex computer systems



---
## Means-Ends Reasoning

*   Means-Ends: "from means to ends"
    *   Means = "What can the agent do"
    *   Ends = Goals
*   Agent has:
    *   Representation of task to be achieved (intention)
    *   Representation of actions it can perform
    *   Representation of environment
*   Based on this knowledge it attempts to generate/select a plan to achieve the task/satisfy the intention
*   Planning = automated programming: the design of a course of action that will achieve some desired goal
*   Mechanisms for plan generation/selection
    *   Planning from first principles: Automated (AI) planning
    *   Planning from second principles: Select a suitable plan from library


---
## The mother of BDI architectures: IRMA <sup><sup>(Bratman et al, 1987)</sup></sup>

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_039.gif#centering)


---
## Abstract BDI Agent interpreter <sup><sup>(Rao and Georgeff, 1991)</sup></sup>

```
initialize-state();
repeat
    options = option-generator(event-queue); 
    selected-options = deliberate(options); 
    update-intentions(selected-options); execute();
    get-new-external-events(); 
    drop-successful-attitudes(); 
    drop-impossible-attitudes();
end repeat
``` 
        
---
## Plattforms for modelling/running BDI agents

*   To realize systems as BDI agent systems, we need
    *   Programming/modelling languages
    *   Runtime execution platforms
    *   Modelling and development tools
*   First practically usable implemented BDI system: Procedural Reasoning System PRS <sup><sup>(Georgeff and Lansky, 1987)</sup></sup>
*   Since then: numerous extensions and re-implementations
*   In this course, we shall investigate as an example:
    *   Programming/modelling language: AgentSpeak
    *   Interpreter/Platform: LightJason


---
## PRS System (Agent) Architecture

![image](slides/sociotechnicalsystems1/image_040.png#centering)



---
## AgentSpeak and LightJason

*   AgentSpeak is a language for defining executable PRS-style BDI agents
*   Paradigm: Logic Programming
    *   Facts are represented by logical formulae
    *   Solve problem/achieve goal -> Prove formulae via logical inference
*   LightJason is a scalable implementation of an AgentSpeak interpreter with many useful features and extensions
*   In the simulation lab part of this course, you will get an introduction into LightJason and have a chance to play around with the system by analysing and extending a small traffic scenario model
